# CF-372C Watching Fireworks is Fun

A festival will be held in a town's main street. There are $n$ sections in the main street. The sections are numbered $1$ through $n$ from left to right. The distance between each adjacent sections is $1$ .

In the festival $m$ fireworks will be launched. The $i$-th $(1\le i\le m)$ launching is on time $t_{i}$ at section $a_{i}$. If you are at section $x (1\le x\le n)$ at the time of $i$-th launching, you'll gain happiness value $b_{i}-|a_{i}-x|$ (note that the happiness value might be a negative value).

You can move up to $d$ length units in a unit time interval, but it's prohibited to go out of the main street. Also you can be in an arbitrary section at initial time moment (time equals to $1$ ), and want to maximize the sum of happiness that can be gained from watching fireworks. Find the maximum total happiness.

Note that two or more fireworks can be launched at the same time.

## Input

The first line contains three integers $n, m, d ( 1\le n\le 150000; 1\le m\le 300; 1\le d\le n )$.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains integers $a_{i}, b_{i}, t_{i} (1<=a_{i}<=n; 1<=b_{i}<=10^{9}; 1<=t_{i}<=10^{9})$. The $i$-th line contains description of the $i$-th launching.

It is guaranteed that the condition $t_{i}<=t_{i+1} (1\le i < m)$ will be satisfied.

## Output

Print a single integer  the maximum sum of happiness that you can gain from watching all the fireworks.

Please, do not write the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

## Examples

Input 1:

```
50 3 1
49 1 1
26 1 4
6 1 10
```

Output 1:

```
-31
```

Input 2:

```
10 2 1
1 1000 4
9 1000 4
```

Output 2:

```
1992
```

## Solution

单调队列优化 dp

基本转移方程如下，$f[t][x]$ 表示 $t$ 时刻在位置 $x$ 时累计最大开心度。显然 t 可以离散化，由于输入已经对时间排好序了，实现时只需维护一个区间即可，同时记得把 $d$ 乘上时间差。然后使用滚动数组dp

$$
f[t][x] = \sum (b_i - |a_i - x|) \max_{-d \le y\le d} f[t-1][y]
$$

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
using ll = long long;
const int N = 2e5;
const ll INF = 1e18;

ll a[N], b[N], t[N];
ll f[2][N];

int main() {
  int n, m, d;
  cin >> n >> m >> d;
  for (int i = 0; i < m; i ++)
    cin >> a[i] >> b[i] >> t[i];

  int cur = 0;
  ll dx = INF;
  for (int l = 0, r = 0; r < m; cur ^= 1) {
    l = r;
    while (r < m && t[l] == t[r]) r ++;

    static pair<int, ll> q[N];
    int ql = 0, qr = 0, j = 1;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x ++) {
      while (ql < qr && q[ql].first < x - dx) ql ++;
      for (; j <= x + dx && j <= n; j ++) {
        ll v = f[cur^1][j];
        while (ql < qr && q[qr-1].second <= v) qr --;
        q[qr++] = {j, v};
      }
      f[cur][x] = q[ql].second;
      for (int i = l; i < r; i ++)
        f[cur][x] += b[i] - abs(a[i] - x);
    }

    if (r < m) dx = (t[r] - t[l]) * d;
  }
  cout << *max_element(f[cur^1]+1, f[cur^1]+n+1);
  return 0;
}
```
